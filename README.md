I am learning how to make repositories

Hi everyone!

I am Kim Juni Jala, a newbie tech savvy. I don't know a lot about codes but I'm willing to learn. I hope to be able to create a simple software or app someday that would other people to have a more convenient time in managing their personal timeline and who knows businesses someday. 

Thank you for listening (or reading for that matter, lol!)
